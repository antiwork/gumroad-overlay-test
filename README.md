# Gumroad widgets test

This is a simple web app for testing the Gumroad overlay and embed widget.

More information on how to implement and customize the widgets can be found [in our docs](https://gumroad.com/widgets).

### Run the web app:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gumroad/web-overlay-test.git
cd web-overlay-test
bundle install
ruby web.rb
```

### Making changes to the app:

Keep it simple and as close to what a Gumroad creator will do. This app is designed to be a simple test that mirrors what our users will do when they use the Gumroad widgets.
